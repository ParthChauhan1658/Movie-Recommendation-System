# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies to users based on their preferences or similarities with other movies. The system leverages machine learning techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches to provide personalized recommendations.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from MovieLens , a popular dataset for building recommendation systems. It includes the following key features:
User ID : Unique identifier for each user.
Movie ID : Unique identifier for each movie.
Ratings : Ratings given by users to movies (1â€“5 scale).
Movie Titles : Names of the movies.
Genres : Categories or genres associated with each movie (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama).
The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare it for training recommendation models.
